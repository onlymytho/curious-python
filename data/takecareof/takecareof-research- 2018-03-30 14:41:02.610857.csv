Vitamin B12,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Vitamin B12 is a necessary component of DNA production, the function of blood cells and nervous system processes. It is commonly found in animal products and not present in fruits or vegetables. As a result, vegans and vegetarians are at higher risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Older adults are also found to have lower vitamin B12 levels because they have difficulty absorbing it. The FDA recommends 2.4mcg of vitamin B12 per day, but supplements often include much higher levels.  ",Cognitive and Nervous System,"From 2006 to 2008, men and women aged 45 to 69 from Eastern Europe were studied to observe the effect of serum folate and B12 on cognitive function. Immediate and delayed recall tests, verbal fluency tests, and letter search tests were administered at the baseline and end of the study period. Participants with the highest levels of folate scored the best on verbal fluency and immediate recall test. High vitamin B12 levels were also associated with better word recall and higher verbal fluency scores. This study provides exciting results to be expanded upon with randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.A cross-sectional study  was performed on 2,287 adults aged 72 to 83. The study found 7% of participants were deficient in B12 and an additional 10% of participants had low levels. B12 deficient status was associated with greater insensitivity to light and touch and worse nerve conduction amplitude and velocity.

Vitamin C,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin found in abundance in foods such as peppers, citrus fruits, broccoli and strawberries. Most animals can synthesize vitamin C endogenously, but humans cannot. Vitamin C is known for its antioxidant properties and ability to fight free radicals. In the 1700s, scurvy was a common problem for sailors on long trips out at sea, causing symptoms such as bleeding gums, poor wound-healing, depression, seizures, and other symptoms leading to death. In 1747, a Scottish Naval surgeon, James Lind, discovered citrus fruits, high in vitamin C, can prevent scurvy.",Immune system,"A meta-analysis reviewed 60+ studies on the effect of vitamin C on the common cold. The six largest studies in the review concluded vitamin C does not help prevent colds in normal adults, but it may help prevent colds in people under acute physical stress. Vitamin C supplementation does have an effect on reducing the duration of colds. In the four largest studies, the duration of colds for subjects was reduced by only 5%, however, two of these studies found a 12 – 41% reduction on school or work absence, which may indicate vitamin C’s ability to reduce symptoms. Three studies showed at least 80% reduction in incidence of pneumonia from people using vitamin C.A smaller review examined the effect of Vitamin C on patients under acute physical stress. This analysis was on three placebo-controlled studies of skiers, military troops and ultra-marathon runners. Each of the studies found a significant reduction in the incidence of the common cold.  A further examination of the study on ultra-marathon runners reported 600mg of vitamin C per day resulted in a 35% decrease in incidence of colds.

Vitamin D,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Vitamin D3 is essential for bone health and many of us simply don’t get enough of it. The best source of Vitamin D3 is from direct sunlight; however, many people don’t get enough exposure to direct light as they would need to meet their vitamin D needs. Additionally, as we age, the capacity of our skin to synthesize Vitamin D3 decreases. Vitamin D3 is not highly prevalent in many foods, although many milk products on the market are fortified with Vitamin D. People who are lactose intolerant and those who don’t get enough sunlight may be at risk of deficiency.",Sunlight,"Vitamin D is found in our diet, but we also produce it through exposure to sunlight. However, a number of factors impact the ability for people to get necessary levels of vitamin D through sun exposure.Regional factors that prevent people from getting sun exposure include cloud cover patterns, smog, and the angle with which the sun hits the earth. In cities north of 37 degrees latitude (imagine a line drawn between San Francisco and Richmond, VA), it’s hard for people to produce enough vitamin D from sun exposure, especially between the months of November and March.The ability for skin to absorb light also impacts how well people can produce vitamin D, as does the use of sunscreen and the number of hours per day spent inside. It should be noted that UVB rays necessary to produce vitamin D do not penetrate glass, so sitting near a window indoors won’t help you produce sufficient vitamin D.

Prenatal,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Research has shown that certain nutrients, like folic acid and iron, are essential for a healthy pregnancy and can reduce the chance of birth defects. Prenatal vitamins including these key nutrients are recommended for women who are pregnant, for woman who are planning to become pregnant, and for women who are breastfeeding.",Prenatal,"Most women who are expecting take nutrition and wellness seriously for good reason, and as part of that, discover the importance of prenatal vitamins. A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2009 found that 95% of pregnant women surveyed were taking vitamins to support a healthy pregnancy. This study also found significantly lower rates of miscarriages for women who take vitamins during pregnancy (1) Below we examine some of the ingredients commonly found in prenatal vitamins and how they support pregnancy.Folic AcidThis B-vitamin is the most well-researched nutrient for pregnant women. Consuming folic acid has been shown to prevent neural tube defects, or birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord. In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all women capable of becoming pregnant should consume 400mcg of folic acid per day in order to prevent neural tube defects. They believe that supplementing with 400mcg of folic acid per day could prevent approximately 50% of neural tube defects (3). A separate study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found a 72% reduction in neural tube defects among mothers who supplemented with folic acid (4). In 2010, a meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Epidemiology suggests folic acid can reduce neural tube defects by 46%. (20).The FDA noted these results in an April 2015 statement: “The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing 4 milligrams (4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily before conception and continuing into early pregnancy had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect” (2). It should be noted that folic acid supplementation is recommended both for pregnant women and women seeking to become pregnant.Vitamin B12Recent studies have shown that B12 deficiency during pregnancy has become more prevalent as folic acid intake has increased (6). A study in India found that babies born with high folic acid and low vitamin B12 were more likely to have higher adiposity and insulin resistance (5). B12 is often poorly digested and vegetarians are at high risk of B12 deficiency. A review study published in 2014 in Nutrition Reviews claims that B12 deficiency in infants can cause: “irritability, failure to thrive, apathy, anorexia and developmental regression”(7).Vitamin CA randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study published in 2005 suggests vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of PROM (premature rupture of the chorioamniotic membranes) (8). The FDA has set a recommended daily intake of 120 mg per day of vitamin C for pregnant and lactating women, compared to 90mg for men and non-pregnant females.Vitamin DA 2009 study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that women who were deficient in vitamin D were almost four times more likely to need a caesarean section (9). Another study published in 2007 found that women who had preeclampsia were twice as likely to be deficient in vitamin D (10).CholineCholine is a water-soluble vitamin that humans produce in the liver and can get from several food sources including milk, brown rice, and certain nuts and vegetables. A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that women in the highest percentile of dietary choline intake had significantly less risk of neural tube defects when compared to pregnant women who were in the bottom 25th percent of dietary choline intake (11). A review article published in The Journal of Pediatrics in 2006 concludes that choline is needed for brain hippocampal development and normal neural tube closure (12).Vitamin EA study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine suggests that women with higher rates of vitamin E during pregnancy produce children with lower rates of asthma symptoms (13).Vitamin AVitamin A is important for lung development, especially in the second and third trimester (14). A study published in 1984 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition states that “mothers of premature infants had lower levels of serum vitamin A than those of full-term infants suggesting maternal vitamin A status to be one of the correlates of prematurity. Significant correlations were found between cord serum vitamin A, maternal serum vitamin A, gestational age, and growth status” (15).ZincZinc deficiency can lead to poor fetal growth and low birth weight. A study published in the Journal of American Medicine in 1995 studied 580 low-income women with low serum zinc concentrations. These women were given 25mg per day of zinc or a placebo. The group supplementing with zinc had a 37% reduction in the number of babies born with very low birth weight (16).SeleniumA study published in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women in the UK who experienced preeclampsia had lower selenium levels than a sample of women who did not experience preeclampsia (18).IronAccording to a CDC report from 1998, “iron deficiency is the most common known form of nutritional deficiency. Its prevalence is highest among young children and women of childbearing age (particularly pregnant women). In children, iron deficiency causes developmental delays and behavioral disturbances, and in pregnant women, it increases the risk for a preterm delivery and delivering a low-birthweight baby” (19). In the same report, the CDC recommends a low-dose iron supplement for all pregnant women. The CDC report also states that “among pregnant women, iron deficiency anemia during the first two trimesters of pregnancy is associated with a twofold increased risk for preterm delivery and a threefold increased risk for delivering a low birth weight baby . Evidence from randomized control trials indicates that iron supplementation decreases the incidence of iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, but trials of the effect of universal iron supplementation during pregnancy on adverse maternal and infant outcomes are inconclusive” (19).Fish OilThe FDA recommends that pregnant women consume 2-3 servings of fish per week. A fish oil supplement can be a good substitution if you do not eat fish (21).CalciumCalcium has been shown to be beneficial for gestational hypertension. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed on 189 pregnant subjects from 20-weeks’ gestation until delivery. The rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 8.24% in the calcium group and 29.03% in the placebo group. The incidence of gestational hypertension was 6.18% in the calcium group and 17.20% in the placebo group. The rate of preeclampsia was also lower for the calcium group, at 2.06%, compared to 11.82% in the placebo group.A 1999 clinical trial on 456 pregnant Australian women also examined the effect of calcium on gestational hypertension. This study concluded that calcium reduced the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth, but did not decrease the frequency of pregnancy-induced hypertension.In 2010, a meta-analysis reviewed 13 high quality studies involving a total of 15,730 pregnant women. Twelve of the 13 studies, including 15,470 subjects, suggest that calcium supplementation reduces the risk of hypertension during pregnancy. The analysis also concluded that calcium reduces the risk of preterm birth. Most of the women in the trials were low-risk for preterm birth and had a low calcium diet.Coenzyme Q10197 pregnant women with high-risk of preeclampsia were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were designated to receive 200mg of CoQ10 or a placebo daily from 20 weeks of pregnancy until delivery. 30 women in the placebo group experienced pre-eclampsia, compared to 17 in the CoQ10 group.MagnesiumOne of the functions of magnesium is regulating blood pressure. A common problem that women experience during pregnancy is gestational hypertension, or high blood pressure. 61 pregnant women were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of magnesium on gestational hypertension. After 12 weeks of supplementation, the average diastolic blood pressure and incidence of hypertension was significantly lower in the group receiving magnesium.

Vitamin K2 plays a special role in your body, in circulating calcium to your bones and teeth and away from your arteries. Vitamin K2 inhibits arterial and soft-tissue calcification by stimulating matrix Gla protein. ",Bone Health,"Post-menopausal women, who have the highest rate of osteoporosis, were selected for a 2009 clinical study on the effects of Vitamin K on bone health. 244 healthy postmenopausal women were given 180mcg per day of vitamin K2 or a placebo for three years, and their bone strength and density was measured each year. Vitamin K2 reduced age-related decline in bone mineral content and bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the total hip. Bone strength was affected positively by vitamin K2 and a decrease in the loss of vertebral height in the lower thoracic region was found.In a 1991 study, blood samples were taken from two groups in order to review the levels of vitamin K2. The subjects in the first group had osteoporosis and had experienced a recent fracture; those in the second group were healthy and did not have osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 levels were significantly higher in the group without osteoporosis. In the osteoporosis group, only two of the 29 patients were getting sufficient levels of vitamin K2.

",Heart Health,"Vitamin K2 supports heart health by stimulating Gla-protein in order to prevent calcification of the arteries and soft-tissue. Clinical studies have attempted to further prove the benefits of vitamin K2 for heart health.16,057 women who were free of cardiovascular disease were analyzed using a food frequency questionnaire. After approximately 8 years there were 480 cases of cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) in the group. The average daily vitamin K2 intake for the patients who developed CHD was 29.1mcg, far below the recommended daily intake of 80mcg/day.A 2004 study also reviewed vitamin K2 intake and its relation to CHD. The Rotterdam study reviewed the dietary intake of 4,807 subjects. They found the relative risk of CHD mortality and severe aortic calcification was reduced in the middle and upper tiers of vitamin K2 consumption when compared to the lower tier.A 2015 clinical study attempted to prove a link between vitamin K2 and arterial stiffness. 244 healthy post-menopausal women were randomized and given either a placebo or 180mcg of vitamin K2 per day. After three years, the group receiving vitamin K2 showed fewer signs of arterial stiffness than the placebo group when measured using echotracking.

Calcium Plus,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Calcium is the most prevalent mineral in the human body. It can be found in high amounts in dairy, oranges, and some fish. It is an essential mineral and is necessary for muscle contraction, blood clotting, communication between cells, and regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. Our bones and teeth store 99% of our body’s calcium. When your body doesn’t get enough calcium, it will start to take the calcium from your bones and teeth and distribute it elsewhere. As we age, our bones lose their strength, which is when calcium becomes most important. In fact, the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 1,200mg of calcium per day. ",Bone Health,"It is well established that adequate calcium intake is important to prevent osteoporosis. Since osteoporosis is a disease that most commonly affects the elderly, they are typically the subject of clinical studies on calcium.In a 1997 study, 318 volunteers over the age of 65 participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This three-year study found that total body bone mineral density was improved in the group receiving calcium and vitamin D.However, it did not show a significant difference in the bone mineral density at the hip and femoral spine between the two groups. The placebo group exhibited a higher fracture rate, at 12.9% compared to 5.9% for the  group receiving calcium and vitamin D.An even larger study on 1,765 elderly women found similar results to the trial mentioned above. This 1992 study found 32 percent fewer non-vertebral fractures and 43 percent fewer hip fractures in a group receiving vitamin D and calcium versus the placebo group. After 18 months, the group receiving vitamin D and calcium also experienced a 2.7% increase in bone density at the proximal femoral region, while the placebo group had a 4.6% decrease. This study did not show any changes in serum creatinine, phosphorus, osteocalcin, and total protein concentrations. The studies above were on the elderly, and more studies should be performed on a wider group of the population.A double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 930 volunteers gave participants 1,200mg of calcium or a placebo for 4 years. Subjects were monitored over the course of the study and for several years after.. During the course of treatment, only 15 participants experienced fractures from minimal trauma in the treatment group, compared to 29 participants from the placebo group. The benefit of the calcium was only found during the supplementation period. In the years after the treatment had ended, no benefit was found.In 2010, a data analysis was performed on 68,517 participants to prove the effects of calcium and vitamin D. Seven randomized studies were included in the data analysis, which included over 1,000 participants. This meta-analysis reported: “trials using vitamin D with calcium showed a reduced overall risk of fracture and hip fracture. For vitamin D alone in daily doses of 10 micrograms or 20 micrograms, no significant effects were found.” This data supports the synergistic effect of calcium and Vitamin D.

Calcium Plus,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Calcium is the most prevalent mineral in the human body. It can be found in high amounts in dairy, oranges, and some fish. It is an essential mineral and is necessary for muscle contraction, blood clotting, communication between cells, and regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. Our bones and teeth store 99% of our body’s calcium. When your body doesn’t get enough calcium, it will start to take the calcium from your bones and teeth and distribute it elsewhere. As we age, our bones lose their strength, which is when calcium becomes most important. In fact, the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 1,200mg of calcium per day. ",Bone Health,"Healthy bones are of increasing importance as we age – keeping your bones healthy is crucial to reducing the risk of fracture. Calcium and vitamin D are essential minerals to keep your bones healthy and strong. The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 1,200mg of Calcium and 800 - 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day for people over the age of 50, but these minerals are of serious importance to people of all ages.Most of the strong research on calcium and vitamin D has been performed on elderly people since they are at the highest risk of osteoporosis. In a 1997 study, 318 volunteers over the age of 65 participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This three-year study found that total body bone mineral density was improved in the calcium and vitamin D group, however, it did not determine any significant difference in bone mineral density at the hip and femoral spine between the two groups. The placebo group exhibited a higher fracture rate, at 12.9% compared to only 5.9% for the treatment group.An even larger study on 1,765 elderly women found similar results to the trial mentioned above. This 1992 study found 32% fewer non-vertebral fractures and 43% fewer hip fractures in the vitamin D and calcium group than in the placebo group. After 18 months, the Vitamin D and calcium group also experienced a 2.7% increase in bone density at the proximal femoral region, while the placebo group had a 4.6% decrease. This study did not show any changes in serum creatinine, phosphorus, osteocalcin, and total protein concentrations. The studies above were conducted on elderly patients, so more studies should be performed on a wider group of the population to allow for broader conclusions to be drawn.In 2010, a data analysis was performed on 68,517 participants to prove the effects of calcium and vitamin D. Seven randomized studies were included in the data analysis, includingover 1,000 participants. This meta-analysis reported that trials using vitamin D with calcium showed a reduced overall risk of fracture and hip fracture and that people receiving vitamin D alone in daily doses of 10 micrograms or 20 micrograms reported no significant effects. This data supports the synergistic effect of Calcium and vitamin D.

",Pregnancy,"Calcium has been shown to be beneficial for gestational hypertension. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed on 189 pregnant subjects from 20-weeks’ gestation until delivery. The rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 8.24% in the calcium group and 29.03% in the placebo group. The incidence of gestational hypertension was 6.18% in the calcium group and 17.20% in the placebo group. The rate of preeclampsia was also lower for the calcium group, at 2.06%, compared to 11.82% in the placebo group.A 1999 clinical trial on 456 pregnant Australian women also examined the effect of calcium on gestational hypertension. This study concluded that calcium reduced the risk of preeclampsia and pre-term birth, but did not decrease the frequency of pregnancy-induced hypertension.In 2010, a meta-analysis reviewed 13 high-quality studies involving a total of 15,730 pregnant women. Twelve of the 13 studies including 15,470 subjects suggest that calcium supplementation reduces the risk of hypertension during pregnancy. The analysis also concluded that calcium reduces the risk of preterm birth. Most of the women in the trials were low-risk for pre-term birth and had a low calcium diet.

",Sunlight,"Vitamin D is found in our diet, but we also produce it through exposure to sunlight. However, a number of factors impact the ability for people to get necessary levels of vitamin D through sun exposure.Regional factors that prevent people from getting sun exposure include cloud cover patterns, smog, and the angle with which the sun hits the earth. In cities north of 37 degrees latitude (imagine a line drawn between San Francisco and Richmond, VA), it’s hard for people to produce enough vitamin D from sun exposure, especially between the months of November and March.The ability for skin to absorb light also impacts how well people can produce vitamin D, as does the use of sunscreen and the number of hours per day spent inside. It should be noted that UVB rays necessary to produce vitamin D do not penetrate glass, so sitting near a window indoors won’t help you produce sufficient vitamin D.

",Bone Health,"Post-menopausal women, who have the highest rate of osteoporosis, were selected for a 2009 clinical study on the effects of Vitamin K on bone health. 244 healthy postmenopausal women were given 180mcg per day of vitamin K2 or a placebo for three years, and their bone strength and density was measured each year. Vitamin K2 reduced age-related decline in bone mineral content and bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the total hip. Bone strength was affected positively by vitamin K2 and a decrease in the loss of vertebral height in the lower thoracic region was found.In a 1991 study, blood samples were taken from two groups in order to review the levels of vitamin K2. The subjects in the first group had osteoporosis and had experienced a recent fracture; those in the second group were healthy and did not have osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 levels were significantly higher in the group without osteoporosis. In the osteoporosis group, only two of the 29 patients were getting sufficient levels of vitamin K2.

Clinical studies have attempted to further prove the benefits of vitamin K2 for heart health.16,057 women who were free of cardiovascular disease were analyzed using a food frequency questionnaire. After approximately 8 years there were 480 cases of cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) in the group. The average daily vitamin K2 intake for the patients who developed CHD was 29.1mcg, far below the recommended daily intake of 80mcg/day.A 2004 study also reviewed vitamin K2 intake and its relation to CHD. The Rotterdam study reviewed the dietary intake of 4,807 subjects. They found the relative risk of CHD mortality and severe aortic calcification was reduced in the middle and upper tiers of vitamin K2 consumption when compared to the lower tier.A 2015 clinical study attempted to prove a link between vitamin K2 and arterial stiffness. 244 healthy post-menopausal women were randomized and given either a placebo or 180mcg of vitamin K2 per day. After three years, the group receiving vitamin K2 showed fewer signs of arterial stiffness than the placebo group when measured using echotracking.

This mineral impacts wound healing, DNA synthesis, immune function, protein absorption and cell division. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired sense of taste and smell, impotence in men, diarrhea, poor night vision, and weight loss. ",Immune system,"In 2008, fifty volunteers were recruited within 24 hours of developing symptoms of the common cold. They were randomly assigned to a placebo group or a treatment group receiving zinc. This double-blind study gave the zinc group 13.3mg of zinc every 2-3 hours during the waking day. Compared with the placebo group, the zinc group had a shorter mean overall duration of cold (4.0 vs. 7.1 days), shorter duration of cough (2.1 vs. 5.0 days), and shorter duration of nasal discharge (3.0 vs. 4.5 days). Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory markers were also improved in the zinc group. While these results are promising, it should be noted that subjects received a high amount of zinc in response to acute cold symptoms that should not be taken on a daily basis.In 2007, a 12 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on elderly patients to determine the effect of zinc on the immune system. After zinc supplementation, the incidence of infections among the treatment group was significantly lower, plasma zinc was significantly higher, and oxidative stress markers were significantly lower in comparison to the placebo group.","[<li class=""reference"" data-id=""zinc-cold-2008-infectious-disease""><div class=""reference__title"">Duration and severity of symptoms and levels of plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor, and adhesion molecules in patients with common cold treated with zinc acetate.</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Prasad AS, Beck FW, Bao B, Snell D, Fitzgerald JT., </div><div class=""reference__journal"">The Journal of Infectious Diseases, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2008</div></li>, <li class=""reference"" data-id=""zinc-infection-elderly-AJCN-2007""><div class=""reference__title"">Zinc supplementation decreases incidence of infections in the elderly: effect of zinc on generation of cytokines and oxidative stress.</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Prasad AS, Beck FW, Bao B, Fitzgerald JT, Snell DC, Steinberg JD, Cardozo LJ., </div><div class=""reference__journal"">The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2007</div></li>]"

Ashwagandha,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Ashwagandha has been used for over 3,000 years and has a wide variety of names, like winter cherry and Indian ginseng. It has been praised in traditional Indian medicine for its adaptogenic properties; it is considered to help the body adapt to stress, as well as exert a normalizing effect upon bodily processes. In most cases, the roots of the ashwagandha plant are used for their medicinal properties, however, the leaves and seeds also have beneficial properties. This herb grows in the Mediterranean and across the middle east, Africa, India and Pakistan. ",Stress,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed on 64 subjects. Each subject was given 300mg of ashwagandha extract 2x per day or a placebo. The volunteers were then asked to complete a stress-assessment test. After 60 days, the volunteers taking ashwagandha expressed a 44% reduction in stress, whereas the placebo group only showed a 5.5% reduction. Levels of serum cortisol, the stress hormone, were also significantly lower in the group taking ashwagandha – a 27.9% reduction in cortisol levels after 60 days.Another 2016 study found similar results to the study referenced above. In this study, volunteers taking ashwagandha reported improved scores on the “Perceived Stress Scale” and the “Oxford Happiness Questionnaire”. As a precursor to the studies mentioned above, ashwagandha was found to have anti-stress activity in Wistar Rats.

",Strength and Endurance,"In 2015, 50 healthy male and female athletes were recruited for an endurance study. The athletes performed a shuttle run and their VO2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake, was recorded. Over the course of 12-weeks, the group supplementing with ashwagandha experienced a significant increase in mean VO2 max when compared to the baseline results.A clinical study on the efficacy of ashwagandha to enhance strength was performed on 57 young male subjects with limited resistance training experience. The men were given ashwagandha or a placebo and put through a training regimen and the results were recorded over an 8-week period. The ashwagandha group showed greater improvement in leg extension and bench press strength. Additionally, they showed a greater size increase in arms and chest and improvements in testosterone. Compared to the placebo group, the ashwagandha users experienced a decrease in exercise-induced muscular damage and body fat percentage. These results are encouraging, and more research should be done on a larger population group to help confirm this benefit.","[<li class=""reference"" data-id=""Ashwagandha-endurance-athletes""><div class=""reference__title"">Efficacy of Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera [L.] Dunal*) in improving cardiorespiratory endurance in healthy athletic adults</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Choudhary B, Shetty A and Langade D.G., </div><div class=""reference__journal"">AYU Journal - An International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2015</div></li>, <li class=""reference"" data-id=""Ashwagandha-muscle-strength""><div class=""reference__title"">Examining the effect of *Withania somnifera* supplementation on muscle strength and recovery: a randomized controlled trial</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Wankhede S, Langade D, Joshi K, Sinha S and Bhattacharyya S. , </div><div class=""reference__journal"">Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2015</div></li>]"

Its first recorded medical usage dates back to 77 C.E. in De Materia Medica. It is often called “golden root” because of its color or “roseroot” because of the rose-like fragrance it gives off when it is cut. Rhodiola has been used it traditional medicine for improving mood, enhancing energy, and stress relief. This adaptogenic herb and has the ability to increase its resistance against chemical, biological and physical stressors.  ",Energy and Focus,"Rhodiola has been studied extensively for its anti-fatigue abilities. In 2000, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was published examining the effect of rhodiola on students during a stressful examination period. This test found rhodiola to improve mental fatigue and neuro-motoric tests, however, it didn’t prove to be effective in other tests, such as a correction of text test and a neuro-muscular tapping test. A more recent study published in 2009 determined rhodiola helped individuals with stress-related fatigue. They showed better results than the placebo group in tests administered to determine fatigue and ability to concentrate.Although most tests have showed positive or mixed results, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on military cadets aged 19 – 21 didn’t find a significant difference in the effect or rhodiola vs placebo in mental ability tests; however, it did show a significant improvement in the mood and feelings of well-being for the cadets taking rhodiola.A recent study published in the Journal of Sport and Health science tested the effects of Rhodiola on a group of 26 healthy young men. They performed tests to determine whether the herb would affect reaction time and endurance. During psychomotor testing, the rhodiola group performed superior to placebo in reaction time and total response time. This study did not show any improvement in endurance for the men taking rhodiola.One of the most encouraging clinical studies was performed on 56 young, healthy physicians. This 6-week test used a “Fatigue Index” test to determine the overall level of mental fatigue, involving complex perceptive and cognitive cerebral functions, such as associative thinking, short-term memory, calculation and ability of concentration, and speed of audio-visual perception. Physicians were tested before and after night duty. The doctors showed better scores during the time-period when they were taking rhodiola than they did during the time period they were taking placebo (this was a crossover study).

Elderberry,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) is native to North Africa, Europe and Asia. The berries grow on deciduous trees that can reach 30 feet in height and bloom in late summer or early fall. The earliest references to elderberry for medicinal purposes can be traced back to Hippocrates circa 470-410 BCE.  It has been used in traditionally for immune health, and recently, promising clinical research has emerged to confirm this usage. In addition to its medicinal purposes, elderberries have been used for flavoring, and to make wines and pies. ",Immune,"Elderberry has been the subject of strong clinical research both in-vitro and in-vivo in recent years. An in-vitro study found that elderberry extract binds to H1N1 virions (swine flu particles) and blocks the ability of the virus to infect host cells. This activity is similar to that of well-known anti-influenza drugs, such as oseltamivir, the generic form of Tamiflu®, and amantadine. Another study showed elderberry to possess antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria in liquid cultures. The elderberry extract also displayed an inhibitory effect on the propagation of human pathogenic influenza viruses.A study on the immune effects of elderberry was conducted on people who travel by air and are particularly susceptible to colds and upper-respiratory infections. A 2009 study evaluated passengers traveling from Australia; the 312 passengers were split into two groups, one receiving placebo, and another receiving 900mg per day of elderberry extract. The participants were tested at baseline, just before travel, and again 4 days after travel. There were more cold episodes in the placebo group; however, not a significant amount more (17 in the placebo group, 12 in the elderberry group). Elderberry takers did show a much shorter duration of their cold symptoms: those in the placebo group spent 117 days feeling sick, and those in the elderberry group spent 57 days feeling sick.","[<li class=""reference"" data-id=""elderberry-H1N1-phytochemistry-2009""><div class=""reference__title"">Elderberry flavonoids bind to and prevent H1N1 infection in vitro.</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Roschek B Jr, Fink RC, McMichael MD, Li D, Alberte RS., </div><div class=""reference__journal"">Phytochemistry, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2009</div></li>, <li class=""reference"" data-id=""elderberry-air-travel-nutrients-2016""><div class=""reference__title"">Elderberry Supplementation Reduces Cold Duration and Symptoms in Air-Travellers: A Randomized, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Tiralongo E, Wee SS, Lea RA., </div><div class=""reference__journal"">Nutrients, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2016</div></li>, <li class=""reference"" data-id=""elderberry-influenza-BMC-2011""><div class=""reference__title"">Inhibitory activity of a standardized elderberry liquid extract against clinically-relevant human respiratory bacterial pathogens and influenza A and B viruses.</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Krawitz C, Mraheil MA, Stein M, Imirzalioglu C, Domann E, Pleschka S, Hain T., </div><div class=""reference__journal"">BMC complementary and alternative medicine, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2011</div></li>]"
Milk Thistle,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Milk thistle is a popular supplement in Germany, which is where many of the clinical studies on the herb have been performed. It is the most studied herb in the world for liver health, and has been used in traditional medicine for over 2,000 years. The Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, even spoke about the beneficial effects in the first century. Silymarin is the active constituent of milk thistle, and it can be found in the plant’s seeds, leaves, and flowers. Found in Europe and the United States, it can be recognized by its beautiful purple flower and sharp spine. ",Liver Health,"Human StudiesA 1989 study published in the Journal of Hepatology examined the effect on milk thistle on 170 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. It examined the survival rate of patients given milk thistle or a placebo over a 41-month period. The results show a significant improvement in survival rate for milk thistle patients with fewer overall deaths and deaths related to liver disease. Milk thistle was especially effective in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.Human studies on milk thistle tend to center around people who are already suffering with liver problems. Some chemotherapy drugs have a damaging effect on the liver; a 2015 study attempted to examine whether milk thistle could help people receiving chemotherapy. The study observed levels of harmful liver-damaging enzymes in a group taking a placebo and a group taking milk thistle. The milk thistle patients exhibited lower levels of liver enzymes detecting damage: SGOT, SGPT, and bilirubin.Animal StudiesThere have been many animal studies performed to try to prove the efficacy of milk thistle. One study on wistar rats showed that milk thistle protects against liver damage. Rats were given CCl4 or CCl4 and milk thistle. The rats given milk thistle group showed a decrease in MDA, a harmful oxidative stress marker in the liver. A mouse study found milk thistle to have a preventative effect against acute liver injury, in part due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Meta-AnalysisIn 2008, a meta-analysis on the effect of milk thistle in liver disease was published in “Research in Complementary Medicine”. The analysis found 19 clinical studies, all of which were double-blind or single-blind human studies. Lower mortality rates, and liver failures were found in the milk thistle patients when compared to placebo; however, results regarding milk thistle’s ability to treat alcoholic liver disease were mixed and inconclusive. Additionally, the researchers determined that milk thistle has no effect on liver disease caused by viral hepatitis.

Patients were split into four groups: (1) garlic, (2) fish oil, (3) garlic and fish oil, and(4) placebo. The placebo group did not see changes in their cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Total cholesterol and LDL-C were lowered for the garlic group and the garlic and fish oil group, but not in the fish oil group. Garlic taken by itself did not have any effect on triglyceride levels. An earlier study in 1993 also found that 12 weeks of garlic supplementation reduced total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, but did not affect HDL-cholesterol or triglycerides.A meta-analysis was performed in 2008. Medline and Embase databases were searched for all randomized, placebo-controlled studies on garlic for blood pressure from 1955 to 2007. 11 studies met the criteria and were reviewed. The conclusion of the analysis is that garlic is a successful treatment for patients with hypertension. Another study on garlic for hypertension was performed after the 2008 meta-analysis. This 2013 study found that garlic reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a 24-week period.

Here, we focus on studies that review the efficacy of *Bifidobacterium lactis* Bl-04 and *Lactobacillus acidophilus* NCFM.It has been well established that antibiotics can induce diarrhea and digestive disturbances. A 2009 clinical study gave 40 volunteers a probiotic mixture or a placebo and studied their digestive health during and after antibiotic use. The test revealed that post-antibiotic fecal microbiota in probiotic-consuming subjects were more similar to the baseline microbiota than the control group. This study concludes the probiotics bolster a more rapid return to pre-antibiotic baseline fecal bacterial microbiota. Simply put, probiotics helped people return to normal digestive health after taking antibiotics.A more recent study was performed on a larger test group of 503 subjects. Patients on antibiotics were given probiotics or a placebo and studied up until 7 days after final antibiotic usage. Between the three groups, 12.5% - 19.6% of probiotic patients experienced antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), while 24.6% of the placebo group struggled with AAD. Another digestive issue, C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD), which is often triggered by antibiotics, was less prevalent in the group taking probiotics. Patients taking probiotics also experienced lower incidence of liquid stools, fever, abdominal pain and bloating.

",Brain,"There has been a lot of research on omega-3 fatty acids and EPA or DHA separately for its effect on cognitive performance. There have been mixed reviews on whether both EPA and DHA are beneficial. We reference some positive evidence for omega-3’s and cognitive health here; however, the clinical and observational results are mixed.485 healthy subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. They were given 900mg of DHA or a placebo and performed Paired Associate Learning (PAL), visuospatial learning, and episodic memory tests. At 24 weeks, the DHA group performed better on the PAL test, and DHA supplementation was also associated with improved immediate and delayed verbal recognition memory scores. However, DHA did not improve working memory or executive function. Plasma DHA levels doubled in the DHA group.Another study used a computerized cognitive test to assess the cognitive performance of a DHA group vs a placebo group. This study found improvements in reaction time of episodic and working memory in the DHA group.In a 2005 clinical study, omega-3 supplementation was associated with an improvement in attention and mood for the omega-3 group versus the placebo group. A population-based study performed a year earlier found that people who consumed more fish in their diet performed better on cognitive battery tests.The effects of omega-3 fatty acids have also been studied for children. Two groups of children with ADHD were randomly assigned EPA or a placebo for 15 weeks in a clinical study. Teachers reported better behavior in the EPA group, but parents did not. Children with lower serum EPA concentrations at baseline showed better response to treatment.Residents 65 years or older were recruited for a prospective cohort study. Cognitive assessment tests were performed three times over six years. Fish intake was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline. In fact, people who ate two or more servings of fish per week were found to have a 13% slower cognitive decline.Plasma levels of EPA and DHA were studied to predict atrophy in the medial temporal lobe gray matter regions in 281 subjects aged 65 or older. Plasma fatty acid levels were reviewed at baseline and again four years later. The study concluded that higher plasma EPA, but not DHA, was associated with lower gray matter atrophy of the right hippocampal/parahippocampal area and of the right amygdala.In a 2012 study, a group of 1,575 dementia-free patients were reviewed for their red blood cell fatty acid levels. Participants in the lowest quartile of red blood cell DHA levels had smaller brain volume and greater white matter hyperintensity volume. Participants with lower DHA also had lower scores on tests of visual memory, executive function and abstract thinking models.Similar results were found in another study of serum phospholipid levels. Higher DHA levels were associated with better performance on tests of nonverbal reasoning, and improved mental flexibility, working memory, and vocabulary on neuropsychological tests. EPA and ALA levels did not show any effect on cognitive performance.A 2008 clinical study assessed the effect of omega-3 on patients with Alzheimer’s disease and patients with mild cognitive impairment. 1,800mg of omega-3 from fish oil elicited cognitive improvements in patients with mild cognitive impairment, but no benefit was found for the Alzheimer’s patients. Higher proportions of EPA were also associated with better cognitive performance.

There have been mixed reviews on whether both EPA and DHA are beneficial. We reference some positive evidence for omega-3’s and cognitive health here; however, the clinical and observational results are mixed.485 healthy subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. They were given 900mg of DHA or a placebo and performed Paired Associate Learning (PAL), visuospatial learning, and episodic memory tests. At 24 weeks, the DHA group performed better on the PAL test, and DHA supplementation was also associated with improved immediate and delayed verbal recognition memory scores. However, DHA did not improve working memory or executive function. Plasma DHA levels doubled in the DHA group.Another study used a computerized cognitive test to assess the cognitive performance of a DHA group vs a placebo group. This study found improvements in reaction time of episodic and working memory in the DHA group.In a 2005 clinical study, omega-3 supplementation was associated with an improvement in attention and mood for the omega-3 group versus the placebo group. A population-based study performed a year earlier found that people who consumed more fish in their diet performed better on cognitive battery tests.The effects of omega-3 fatty acids have also been studied for children. Two groups of children with ADHD were randomly assigned EPA or a placebo for 15 weeks in a clinical study. Teachers reported better behavior in the EPA group, but parents did not. Children with lower serum EPA concentrations at baseline showed better response to treatment.Residents 65 years or older were recruited for a prospective cohort study. Cognitive assessment tests were performed three times over six years. Fish intake was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline. In fact, people who ate two or more servings of fish per week were found to have a 13% slower cognitive decline.Plasma levels of EPA and DHA were studied to predict atrophy in the medial temporal lobe gray matter regions in 281 subjects aged 65 or older. Plasma fatty acid levels were reviewed at baseline and again four years later. The study concluded that higher plasma EPA, but not DHA, was associated with lower gray matter atrophy of the right hippocampal/parahippocampal area and of the right amygdala.In a 2012 study, a group of 1,575 dementia-free patients were reviewed for their red blood cell fatty acid levels. Participants in the lowest quartile of red blood cell DHA levels had smaller brain volume and greater white matter hyperintensity volume. Participants with lower DHA also had lower scores on tests of visual memory, executive function and abstract thinking models.Similar results were found in another study of serum phospholipid levels. Higher DHA levels were associated with better performance on tests of nonverbal reasoning, and improved mental flexibility, working memory, and vocabulary on neuropsychological tests. EPA and ALA levels did not show any effect on cognitive performance.A 2008 clinical study assessed the effect of omega-3 on patients with Alzheimer’s disease and patients with mild cognitive impairment. 1,800mg of omega-3 from fish oil elicited cognitive improvements in patients with mild cognitive impairment, but no benefit was found for the Alzheimer’s patients. Higher proportions of EPA were also associated with better cognitive performance.

Omega-3’s come in several forms; the most common ones are EPA, DHA and ALA. Fatty fish, algae, walnuts, flaxseed, and canola are good sources of omega-3. Many Americans don’t get enough of these foods, and therefore don’t have enough omega-3 circulating in their blood and brain. Omega-3s have been researched to show benefits for heart health, immune and inflammatory responses, metabolism, and the health of skin, hair, nervous system, joints, eyes, and brain.",Heart,"Omega-3 from fish oil has been extensively researched for its benefits on the heart, with studies performed to assess its effects on  cardiovascular disease, cholesterol and hypertension. In fact, the American Heart Association recommends eating fish, particularly fatty fish, at least two times per week. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, herring, lake trout, sardines and albacore tuna are high in omega-3 fatty acids.

Astaxanthin,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Astaxanthin is produced by algae, fungi, and bacteria. Humans do not produce astaxanthin but we get some in our diet when we eat seafood. Crabs, lobsters, salmon, shrimp and other sea creatures owe their red or pinkish color to astaxanthin. The green microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis is considered to be the richest source of astaxanthin. This phytonutrient is available in both natural and synthetic forms, but the synthetic version has not been proven to be efficacious or safe. ",Skin/Anti-Aging,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study assigned 66 subjects to three groups: group 1 was a placebo group; group 2 received astaxanthin, vitamin C, and vitamin E; and group 3 received vitamin C and vitamin E. The patient's’ skin was reviewed at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 20 weeks. Ocular inspection from skin photographs and 3 dimensional images of replicas and wrinkle values, measuring wrinkle areas and wrinkle volume rates revealed significant improvements in the astaxanthin group compared to the other groups.An in-vitro study exposed human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) to moderate doses of UVA light. The fibroblasts were given one of three antioxidants: astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, or beta-carotene. Astaxanthin showed reductions in apoptosis, or cell death and decreases in levels of markers for oxidative stress. Astaxanthin also increased antioxidant enzyme activities. This shows that astaxanthin may reduce oxidative damage on human skin.A mouse study published in 2017 found that astaxanthin supplementation suppressed photoaging features such as transdermal water loss and wrinkle formation in mice exposed to ultraviolet light.

This phytonutrient is available in both natural and synthetic forms, but the synthetic version has not been proven to be efficacious or safe. ",Athletic Performance,"Astaxanthin has been studied in human and animal studies. Research on this ingredient for athletic performance is fairly new, beginning in 2003 with a study on mice examining the effect of exercise-induced stress in mice that ran on a treadmill until exhaustion. Another study on rats in 2014 showed the astaxanthin group delayed time to exhaustion in a swimming test by 29%.Studies on athletes have been shown that astaxanthin can also reduce oxidative stress. A 2014 double-blind, placebo controlled study found that astaxanthin increased positive responses to some oxidative stress markers when tested on soccer players. Additionally, a clinical trial on competitive cyclists showed an increase in power output for the group taking astaxanthin.A 2008 study took 40 healthy paramedic students and split them into two groups: one received 4mg of astaxanthin and one received a placebo. After 6 months, strength, endurance, and explosivity were measured in both groups. The astaxanthin group showed 3 times higher improvement in squatting than the placebo group.

Digestive Enzymes,This scientific research is for informational use only. The results reported may not necessarily occur in all individuals. Care/of provides this information as a service. This information should not be read to recommend or endorse any specific products.,"Digestive enzymes are found in your gastrointestinal system and are necessary for the digestion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. This product contains several enzymes for breaking down food and converting it to energy. ",Digestion,"Lactase: Lactase is produced in the human intestine. This enzyme turns lactose into absorbable sugar. Without lactase enzymes, humans couldn’t digest dairy products. Amylase: This enzyme, made in your pancreas and found in human saliva, starts the digestion process as soon as you begin chewing your food. Its primary function is to digest starch and convert it to sugar.Amyloglucosidase: This enzyme converts starch to dextrins and glucose.Cellulase: This enzyme breaks down cellulose and converts it to beta-glucose. Humans cannot generate cellulase on their own. Since humans can’t produce cellulase, when we eat fibrous plants, the cellulose from the plants is digested by the large intestine through a fermentation process. Much of the plant fibers are left unabsorbed and then excreted from the body.Protease: Protease is important for digestion of proteins, converting proteins into amino acids. Protease enzymes are located in the stomach, intestinal, and pancreatic juicesLipase: Lipase helps break down fats so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Lipase is produced by the pancreas, but can be found in the mouth in saliva, in the stomach. and even in the liver.For more information about enzyme supplementation, please see the link below:http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/13/4/307.pdfhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Anatomy/your-digestive-system/Pages/anatomy.aspx","[<li class=""reference"" data-id=""enzymes-2013-NIH-Digestion""><div class=""reference__title"">Your Digestive System and How It Works</div><div class=""reference__authors"">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, </div><div class=""reference__journal"">National Institute of Health, </div><div class=""reference__year"">2013</div></li>, <li class=""reference"" data-id=""digestive-enzymes-2008-alt-med-review""><div class=""reference__title"">The Role of Enzyme Supplementation in Digestive Disorders</div><div class=""reference__authors"">Mario Roxas, ND, </div><div class=""reference__journal"">Alternative Medicine Review Volume 13, Number 4 , </div><div class=""reference__year"">2008</div></li>]"
